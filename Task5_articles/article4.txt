The year is coming to an end, holiday packing is almost done, and it is high time to unwind and make plans for the upcoming year. If you are a marketer and youâ€™re all about making informed decisions, any plans for the next year need to be guided by data. After all, it is after learning from experience that we are able to make better decisions that bring positive results.

The best example to illustrate the value of data and learning from experience would be the rise of content marketing as a trend within the digital marketing landscape. Those who understood the importance of content marketing and how it fits perfectly with the needs of the digital consumer have spent the past few years adapting to the change. In fact, almost 70% of consumers prefer learning about products through content. 

One may think that marketers would then take this fact and start targeting their customers the right way with content marketing. However, according to a survey published back in 2017, 70% marketers lack a consistent and integrated content strategy. As a result, generating leads and traffic remains a significant challenge for many marketers.
