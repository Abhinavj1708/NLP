While it isnâ€™t always pleasant to think about our mortality, it does us no real good to ignore the reality of it. In fact, taking a practical approach to our end of life plans and funeral arrangements can be empowering. 

Making personal decisions about distributing our assets, and how we would like our lives to be memorialized can give us a sense of personal peace, and also take some of the strain off of our loved ones.

However, one element that is often overlooked when considering plans for when we shuffle off this mortal coil, is our digital presence. You might scoff at the idea, but the fact of the matter is we spend a great deal of our time online, and as such most of us have built up a variety of social media accounts, digital assets, and left a trail of valuable data wherever we go.

So, how can we prepare for a safe and positive digital afterlife? How can we help our loved ones by limiting the legal and practical hurdles they might have to overcome once we pass away and leave our accounts for them to deal with? What are the risks, and how can we mitigate the potential for damage?
