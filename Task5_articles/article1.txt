A Facebook Page For Business Will Make You Look More Professional
Facebook is where people spend an average of an hour per day on their network. There are  1.9. billion daily active users (as of Q3, 2022.) That’s a LOT of active users and time spent on Facebook. It’s where your business needs to be today.

However, you don’t need to spend all your time there as you should have more than 1 social media account as Facebook has been unpublishing pages and removing access for some users recently.

What Are Facebook Business Pages?
Every day I meet with clients that do not understand the difference between a Facebook business page vs. their personal Facebook profile. Many realtors promote their business via their personal Facebook profiles and not with Facebook Pages.

But remember, Facebook Pages are for businesses, brands, and organizations to share their stories and connect with people. They are used differently than a personal Facebook profile.
